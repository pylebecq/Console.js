Console.js
==========

A Javascript port of the Symfony2 Console component.

About
-----

A few weeks ago, I decided to rework my personal website. As a developer, I thought of a website that look like
a terminal.
I found an amazing jQuery plugin to make the website look like a terminal: [jQuery Terminal Emulator][jquery-terminal].

But even with the tools provided in jQuery Terminal Emulator, I missed a really powerful command line interpreter with options and arguments parsing, output formatting, etc.
That's why I decided to port the Symfony Console Component to javascript: To be able to use it as my command line interpreter
in the jQuery Terminal Emulator.

Note
----

This is a project I made for fun only. It was never intended to be production ready.
It means this project:
- is NOT tested by automated tests.
- DOES contain bugs.
- DOES miss some features.
- may contain ugly code.

It also means that:
- There won't be tests. Ever.
- Bugs won't be fixed. Ever.
- Missing features won't be implemented. Ever.
